Thank you for visiting my new blog! I am a data scientist with an entrepreneurial background. As I have aqcuired skills in data science, 
my main focus has been to develop knowledge, and techniques that will help companies become more efficient and profitable by having 
better tools in place to make better business decisions. I believe that most business decision makers are able to make great decisions
for their companies when they are given the best information. 

Data scientists help to generate a great amount of value to companies by answering specific business questions by applying machine learning
 algorithms, and other skills. Data scientists have the ability to provide value by applying manual data science systems, and by using 
automated systems like DataRobot, and Splunk software.
Artificial intelligence(AI) sysytems are processes that formally required humans to perform, and are now automated. AI systems like DataRobot 
and Splunk, generate business value by automating and optimizing processes for actionable insights for executive decision makers.

In future posts, I will be analyzing many data science related topics and techniques that data scientists use to help companies become more 
efficient and profitable by making better business decions.
