Prophet is a software platform created by Facebook's core data science team as a procdeure for 
forecasting time series data. Prophet supports what the team calls "Analyst in the Loop Modeling,"
where current business analysts have significant domain knowledge of their particular industry, but 
they may lack training in time series forcasting. 

Prophet boasts the ability to be accurate and fast. It also has the ability to produce reasonable 
forecasts that can out perform many traditional approaches. Prophet is fully automatic, and is also 
tunable, which can help make the forecast model more interpretable.

This is an analysis of the “Bike Sharing Dataset” from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset
contains the daily count of rented bikes during 2011-2012.

As in all time series analysis, I will visualize the data to examine the patterns of the data and to note 
any irregularies. This chart shows no real evidence of a trend, and strong seasonality.

First I will fit the prophet model, the create the dataframe, which creates the dates of which the predictions
 will be made on. 


##           ds
## 1 2011-01-01
## 2 2011-01-02
## 3 2011-01-03
## 4 2011-01-04
## 5 2011-01-05
## 6 2011-01-06
		
	
Next, I used the "predict" function to get the forecast, and I create a dataframe called "forecast." The column 
"yhat" contains the forecast. 



##              ds     yhat yhat_lower yhat_upper
## 1091 2013-12-26 5580.997   4444.814   6834.478
## 1092 2013-12-27 5604.066   4347.166   6833.899
## 1093 2013-12-28 5521.493   4255.895   6810.019
## 1094 2013-12-29 5224.803   3977.192   6390.138
## 1095 2013-12-30 5371.055   4106.784   6628.873
## 1096 2013-12-31 5587.187   4289.903   6883.783


Next, I plot the forecast. The data is a very small time series dataset from 2011 to 2012. The actual forecast
begins in 2013 to 2014.

The plot below shows the forecast broken down into "trend," "Weekly Seasonality," and "Yearly Sesonality." This
is mainly used to help the analyst understand the data.

Below is a link for the interactive Dyplot of the forecast, which is a great tool.

The Prophet package seems to be a great tool for time series forcasting. I will continue to work with it and to learn all of the 
capabilities of it. I'm sure that Prophet is a great tool for certain situations.
