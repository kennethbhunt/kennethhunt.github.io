Prophet is a software platform created by Facebook's core data science team as a procdeure for 
forecasting time series data. Prophet supports what the team calls "Analyst in the Loop Modeling,"
where current business analysts have significant domain knowledge of their particular industry, but 
the lack training in time series forcasting. 

Prophet boasts the ability to be accurate, and fast, while having the ability to produce reasonable 
forecasts that can out perform many traditional appraoches. Prophet is fully automatic, and it also 
tunable to make the forecast model more interpretable.

This is an analysis of the “Bike Sharing Dataset” from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset
contains the daily count of rented bikes during 2011-2012.

As in all time series analysis, I will visualize the data to examine the patterns of the data and to note 
any irregularies. This chart shows no real evidence of a trend, and strong seasonality.

First I will fit the prophet model, the create the dataframe, which creates the dates of which the predictions
 will be made on. 

1091	2013-12-26			
	
Next, I used the "predict" function to get the forecast, and I create a dataframe called "forecast." The column 
"yhat" contains the forecast. 

 ds           yhat        yhat_lower  yhat_upper

1091 2013-12-26 5580.997   4437.752   6872.344


Next, I plot the forecast...

The plot below shows the forecast broken down into "trend," "Weekly Seasonality," and "Yearly Sesonality." This
is mainly used to help the analyst understand the data.

Below is an interactive Dyplot of the forecast, which is a great tool.

The Prophet package seem to be a great tool for time series forcasting. I will continue to work with it and to learn all of the 
capabilities of it. I'm sure that Prophet is a great tool for certain situations.
