Customer Churn, or customer attrition is a very signifcant metric for companies. it is much less expensive 
for most companies  to retain their current customers than it is to go through many marketing steps in an effort to 
acquire new customers. This is an area  where data science can help companies by setting up systems to predict which 
of a company's customers might by more likely to "churn" orleave the company. 

This is an analysis of a data set containing 6 variables, and 1000 observations. The response variable of this dataset
is “churn”, which describes whether a customer will leave the company based on the other variables which are “predictors”.
The other 5 variable in this dataset are "Tenure", "Age", "Income", "Education", and "Members."

The first thing that I will look at in the dataset is that there is a class imbalance with the number of customers that are
churning "1" and the one who are not churning "0."
